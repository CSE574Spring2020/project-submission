Image Classification of flower images using dataset from https://github.com/SAR2652/Flowers-Recognition/blob/master/flowers.ipynb

**PROJ_SVM.ipynb** - SVM and linear regression on a small subset of the dataset (*flowers.zip* & *tes.csv*) for Balloon Flower and Bird of Paradise.

**Larger_subset.ipynb** - SVM on larger subset of the dataset (*fleur_set.csv*) containg the Balloon Flower, Bird of Paradise, Pink Primrose, Common Dandelion, and King Protea from the dataset. 

**Flower Recognition - CNN.ipynb** - CNN Fine-tuned VGG 16 model using subset of dataset (*CNN flowers dataset.zip*) for only the Balloon Flower and Bird of Paradise. 

**CNN flowers dataset.zip** - Should be downloaded along with *Flower Recognition - CNN.ipynb* and extract and place in the same directory.
