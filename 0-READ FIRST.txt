Github will not let me upload the datasets I used for this project because they were too big, but the download link for them is 

https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/mortality

and the JSON and csv files in the datasets are just placed into the datasets folder

libraries needed to run are pandas, sklearn, numpy, matplotlib, tkinter, and pickle

to run the project just run GUI.py
