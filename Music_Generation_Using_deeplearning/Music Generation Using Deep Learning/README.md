# Music Generation Using Deep-Learning

## Problem Statement
This project focuses on generating music automatically using Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN). 

## How to Run the Model
In order to run the model you can run the file " Train_2.ipynb"
You can also load weights which are in the file" Data2/Model_Weights/". There are total 9 weight files over there. Each weight file represents the epoch number. For instance " Weights_50.h5" are the weights saved at epoch 50. We ran our model for total of 90 epochs. 

## How to Generate Music Sequence
Once the model is defined and weights are calculated then run "Music_Generation.ipynb" file.
