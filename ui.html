<p> For this project we are trying to classify posts on a reddit repository called: aww. Here, we will take thousands of posted pictures when they are uploaded and various times after the same pictures are uploaded and try to build a dataset to predict how many upvotes a certain type of picture will receive. We will be looking at each postsâ€™ title, time of post, and classifying each of the animals in it to help us predict the upvotes as well.
